The course aims at providing knowledge about the Object-Oriented (O.O.) paradigm using the Java programming language. The course will present advanced aspects of the Java programming language, such as annotations, generics, and some useful libraries and frameworks.

Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course, the student should:
1. know the fundamental concepts of the O.O. paradigm, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism defined within the Java language;
2. understand and be able to explain the differences between the object-oriented paradigm and the procedural paradigm;
3. be able to analyze, design and implement a simple system or software component to meet a specific need;
4. be able to describe the decisions made during the development of software, explaining the design choices made, including the architecture of the system and the design and implementation decisions;
5. be able to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of software projects, both those developed internally and those created by third parties, analyzing their strengths and limitations
8. analyze and choose third-party libraries;
7. be able to work in a group to develop a joint project;

These objectives are part of the educational aims of the course of study, as the internal consistency of the three-year degree course in Computer Science was verified and harmonized during its design phase.
