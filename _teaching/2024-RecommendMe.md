This course aims to give comprehensive knowledge about recommender systems, with particular emphasis on recommendations for software engineering tasks. The course will cover the foundational aspects of recommender systems.

**Course content**
- The main concepts the course wants to achieve are the following:
- Introduction to recommender systems (1h, theory)
- Foundational concepts (1,5h, t)
- Main techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based, knowledge-based) (5h, t+lab)
- Evaluation metrics (2,5h, t+lab)
- Common problems (popularity bias, cold start problem) (2,5h, t+lab)
- Integration of machine learning and recommender systems (2,5h, t+lab)
- Real scenarios (Libraries, code snippets, modelling artifacts) (5h, t+lab)

**Intended learning outcomes**
- At the end of the course the student shall be able to:
- Understand the foundational concepts underlying recommendation systems
- Reason about the suitable techniques to be adopted in a specific application scenario and the corresponding problems
- Design and implement recommendation systems through appropriate technologies
